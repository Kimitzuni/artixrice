# The Artix Rice
This repository contains the dotfiles that I use on my Linux machines every day. While they may not be perfect for some people, they work for me and I mostly just
use Git to back them up so I can get them easily when I reinstall Linux - which I do a lot. This repo contains configurations for

> i3 (Window Manager) \
> i3blocks (Status Bar) \
> NeoVIM (Text Editor) \
> NeoMutt (Mail Client) \
> Qutebrowser (Web Browser) \
> ZSH/Fish/Bash (Shell)

and more
